# TODO: Publish `scp-ingest-pipeline` to PyPI upon merging that repo to master.
# PyPI (https://pypi.org) is like NPM or RubyGems, but for Python.
#
# Also, if still using this kludge getting and you get failures in CircleCI,
# then bump cache key in .circleci/config.yml (e.g. v2 -> v3).
# That's a cost of tech debt until we push to PyPI as proposed above.
